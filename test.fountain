EXT. BACKYARD - EVENING

LYLE PENDERGRASS chalks demonic symbols onto the cement ground behind his house. He sets down candles around the symbols, one by one encircling the area in flames. His daughter, KELSEY, is seen watching concerned from the closed glass door at the back of the house. LYLE sees her, opens the door, and pulls her outside. He hands her a framed photograph and sits her down in the center of the marked area.

He begins to walk around her, eyes staring intently at the photograph. She nervously sits there as he walks faster and faster. The candles’ flames flicker in increasing wind. Pieces of chalk left on the ground roll across the ground. KELSEY drops her head in tears as the camera pans down to the photo in her lap: LYLE, KELSEY, and her sister KARA.

Background music hits a crescendo, LYLE stops abruptly in front of KELSEY. KELSEY jerks in surprise, ducking her head and cowering behind the family photo.

LYLE stops walking. Silence, a few seconds tick by.

LYLE
...Kara?

KELSEY hesitantly peers over the photo at her dad. LYLE looks lost for a moment, KELSEY stands up and steps closer to LYLE, she opens her mouth as if to say something. LYLE holds out a hand, then slowly takes the photo from KELSEY’s hand and walks inside.

The candles are blown out by the wind.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

KELSEY sits at the kitchen table eating cereal. She smiles, reading a comic on an iPad. The comic is of a pineapple shouting “That’s it, I’m going back to school!” She laughs as she reads it. The laugh echoes down the hallway, through the doorway into LYLE’s den.

LYLE is passed out at his desk, he wakes up with a start, stumbles out of his chair to a bookshelf and grabs a couple books off the shelf. He then sits back at his desk and begins leafing through their pages, hunched over.

KELSEY stands up giggling and prances down the hallway to her father. Subtly, two sets of footsteps are heard. She opens the door.

KELSEY
Hey! Dad!

LYLE doesn’t respond.

KELSEY
Well, there’s this comic, it’s pretty funny!

LYLE shoos her away with his hand, his face stuck in his demonic books. We see from his point of view, double-vision due to his drunkenness.

KELSEY hugs the iPad to her chest, looks down at the ground.

KELSEY
(mumbling)
I think Kara would’ve liked it.

LYLE puts the book down. We see from his point of view again, but subtly he sees both a frowning KELSEY and a smiling KARA.

[[could be: he sways and his vision blurs, during that moment we see KARA & KELSEY, smiling and frowning up at him respectively.]]

LYLE
Go.

LYLE walks KELSEY out of the room and slams the door in her face. She falls to the ground. LYLE sits back down and opens a bottle of whiskey. Subtly, KARA can be seen hiding in the background behind LYLE.

> FADE TO BLACK

INT. KELSEY’S ROOM

KELSEY is laying on her stomach on her bed. In front of her is a coloring book. she writes: “ARE YOU THERE?”

KARA’s shadow casts over her, KELSEY sits up and looks around quickly. The room is empty.
KELSEY sighs and lays back down, “ARE YOU THERE?” is still written, but it looks like it was written by someone else’s hand.

LYLE turns a page in a book.

KELSEY plays with toys.

LYLE opens a new book, with demonic images inside.

Suddenly, a shot of bloodied KARA laying dead in a yard.

LYLE takes a swig of whiskey.

KELSEY watches TV. Subtly, “GET OUT” is written in her coloring book.

LYLE swats a book off his desk in frustration.

KELSEY lays on the couch, kicking her legs in the air. On her stomach is a bowl of pineapple that she’s eating. The sound of a crash in LYLE’s office jolts her. KELSEY walks to her dads office, the door is cracked open and she can see her dad working and muttering. She can hear KARA’s whispering, KELSEY creeps closer and peers further in. For a second KELSEY sees KARA’s face next to LYLE while the whispering becomes deafening.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

KELSEY watches television as her father enters the room. KELSEY looks over to him.

LYLE
It’ll work this time.

KELSEY is afraid and stares at him. The television flashes. Subtly, KELSEY has two shadows.

INT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT

LYLE pours salt on the floor in demonic symbols, different symbols from before.


KELSEY
(smiling)
Are you sure you want to do this?

LYLE throws the bag of salt into the corner of the room, ignoring KELSEY. He begins placing Jesus-ridden candles around the floor as before. KELSEY grips the photo from before.

KELSEY
(frowning)
I miss her too, dad.

FLASH TO:

KARA and KELSEY playing outside.

KELSEY is up in a tree, gesturing for KARA to follow her.

KARA looks uncertain but starts  climbing.

FLASH TO:

LYLE sits KELSEY in the center of the demonic markings.

KELSEY
(crying)
I’m sorry, dad...

FLASH TO:

KARA’s foot slipping, KELSEY’s expression shifts to horror.

FLASH TO:

LYLE holds up a cross and then holds it towards KELSEY. He shouts inaudible chants at her.

FLASH TO:

KELSEY is clinging to the tree and screaming.

KELSEY
(screaming)
Dad! Dad!

LYLE runs outside, then freezes horrified.

FLASH TO:

LYLE continues to chant. He stares down at KELSEY, whose tears have turned to blood.

[[not holding the photo]]

KELSEY
(smiling)
It’s time, dad.

Down the hallway, the door opens to reveal KELSEY outside the room, holding the photo.

KELSEY
(outside)
Dad?

LYLE looks behind him to see KELSEY. He looks back at the center of the markings to see KARA. Behind him, the door slams shut.

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY

[[Only silence is heard.]] KELSEY walks backwards, touches the wall, then slides down it to the floor. She stares at the door.

CUT TO:

Complete darkness for a moment, then show KARA staring down at something with a serious expression. She turns and walks down the hall to the door.

KARA opens the door, KELSEY looks up at her from the floor. KARA extends her hand. KELSEY grabs it, is listed up, then hand in hand they walk off screen.
